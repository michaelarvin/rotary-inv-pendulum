# rotary-inv-pendulum
A program for my Bachelor's thesis with the title "Implementation of Control of Rotary Inverted Pendulum" using MATLAB/Simulink, STM32, Arduino, and SimpleFOCShield.

The current version has a few mistakes such as the control system itself not accounting certain operating points.
